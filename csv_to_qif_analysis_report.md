- Good basic error handling for date formats and required fields
- Supports stock transactions and basic investment actions

### Areas Needing Improvement
High Priority:
- Add cryptocurrency transaction support
- Implement tax lot date assignment
- Add configurable sales methodologies

Medium Priority:
- Add batch processing capabilities
- Improve error handling specificity
- Add proper logging system

Low Priority:
- Externalize configuration
- Add performance monitoring
- Improve documentation

## CLI Interface (qif_cli.py)

### Current State
- Clean argument parsing
- Good error handling for inputs
- Supports both JSON string and file-based mapping

### Areas Needing Improvement
High Priority:
- Add cryptocurrency support
- Implement tax lot tracking

Medium Priority:
- Replace print statements with logging
- Add progress reporting
- Improve error messages

Low Priority:
- Move default mappings to config
- Add usage examples
- Improve documentation

## GUI Interface (qif_gui.py)

### Current State
- Well-structured class hierarchy
- Good separation of UI and business logic
- Comprehensive transaction validation

### Areas Needing Improvement

## Test Suite

### Current State
- Multiple test categories (unit, integration)
- Good use of fixtures and mocks
- Basic coverage of core functionality

### Areas Needing Improvement
High Priority:
- Add cryptocurrency transaction tests
- Implement tax lot testing
- Add complex sale scenario tests
- Consolidate duplicate test files

Medium Priority:
- Add performance tests
- Improve test organization
- Add end-to-end tests

Low Priority:
- Add test documentation
- Improve test data management
- Add test reporting

## Missing Features Analysis

### Cryptocurrency Support
Current State: Not implemented
Required Changes:
- Add cryptocurrency transaction types
- Implement exchange rate handling
- Add token decimal support
- Implement gas fee tracking
Priority: High

### Tax Lot Date Assignment
Current State: Not implemented
Required Changes:
- Add lot tracking data structures
- Implement date assignment logic
- Add lot matching algorithms
- Support multiple sale methodologies
Priority: High

### Sales Transaction Processing
Current State: Basic implementation
Required Changes:
- Add configurable sale methods (FIFO, LIFO)
- Implement partial lot sales
- Add wash sale detection
- Support multiple lot sales
Priority: High

## Recommendations Summary

### High Priority
1. Implement cryptocurrency support
   - Add new transaction types
   - Handle exchange rates
   - Support token decimals
   - Track gas fees

2. Add tax lot functionality
   - Implement date assignment
   - Add lot tracking
   - Support multiple sale methods
   - Handle partial sales

3. Improve test coverage
   - Add missing feature tests
   - Consolidate test files
   - Add edge case coverage
   - Meet 90% coverage requirement

### Medium Priority
1. Improve error handling
   - Add proper logging
   - Standardize error patterns
   - Improve user feedback

2. Enhance performance
   - Add pagination
   - Implement background processing
   - Add batch operations

3. Improve documentation
   - Add comprehensive README
   - Create user guide
   - Document API

### Low Priority
1. Code organization
   - Externalize configuration
   - Improve code structure
   - Add performance monitoring

2. Test improvements
   - Add test documentation
   - Improve test organization
   - Add test reporting

## Conclusion
While the codebase is well-structured and follows good Python practices, it requires significant additions to meet all requirements, particularly in cryptocurrency support and tax lot management. The test suite needs expansion to meet the 90% coverage requirement and better organization to reduce duplication.
